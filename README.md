## Why this is interesting
I find this article interesting because it helped me build a simple image classifier by using PyTorch, which helped me better understand the fundamentals of deep learning and image classification. The project can be found in my Github acc, and the model is configured for training on CIFAR-10.

Edit by Peter Ma (pjm9792-ui). Yes this is interesting. I built an image classification using Pytorch as well, using the CelebA dataset to detect if someone is smiling or not.
